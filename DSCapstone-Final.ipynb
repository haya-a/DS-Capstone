I'm going to try and be as practical as I can with this decision seeing how I am personally invested.\n\nThe idea of healthy eating is gaining popularity here in Qatar. Slowly but surely, people are making an effort to eat responsibly, especially when it comes to their kids. In this project we want to focus on localities close to schools since that is a place of particular interest. It would also help our cause if no other cafes are in the vicinity since we primarily sell snacks, not fully-plated food.\n\nUsing all my data science experience, I set forth to discover the best location possible for this investment."
